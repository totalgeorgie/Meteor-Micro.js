#Meteor-Micro

Built out a basic Reddit-clone using Meteor.js, the full-stack all-reactive all-Javascript framework OF THE FUTURE. Followed along with the tutorial at discovermeteor.com. User authentication, posting, database-persistence, pagination, etc. So far Meteor has not hit v1.0 and isn't safe for production work yet, but I really do love the Mongo/Node/Meteor all-Javascript stack, and hope to revisit Meteor in the future.
